# Railway Chatbot Project
This project runs on a NodeJS backend and a React Front-end, both are using typescript.

## Set Up
After cloning the repository, initialise the front-end and back-end by going into the respective directories and using the command `npm install` this will install all the project dependencies.

## Instructions for Running the project

To run the front-end or the back-end to test your changes, go to the respective directory then run
`npm run dev`

# Adding to the project
Make sure to put all new features into the src folders and it should be fine, as long as the file is labelled nicely.

## Github
I've set the github up so it won't let you push to main directly, so don't worry about breaking anything, just make sure you make your own branch then make a pull-request when you're done with your feature then we can merge it into main without interfering with each others' tasks and we always have a functional version of our work.
